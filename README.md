# awesome config

This is my configuration for the [awesome window manager](http://awesome.naquadah.org).

Highlights:

* Custom set of widgets, note that some require [Vicious](http://git.sysphere.org/vicious/).
* Optimized for Dvorak keyboard.
* Random wallpaper rotator.
* Includes a matching Chromium theme.
* Works on all my Arch linux computers.
